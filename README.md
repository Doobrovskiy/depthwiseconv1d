# Keras 1D Depthwise Convolutional layer

As of Tensorflow 2.2 still does not implement DepthwiseConv1D layer I have implemented it myself, as I find it useful in many applications, such as those collecting timeseries data from multiple channels of same or similar nature.

There are only 2 files in this project
- dwconv1d/depthwiseconv1d.py contains the layer code
- example.py contains example code

Please notify me of any problems.
